Evening Alchemist Planner — Overview

Purpose
A daily reflection and planning companion. Users talk with Praxis (AI) to process experiences, notice patterns, and connect actions to goals. Minimal UI, strong continuity over time.

Key Pieces
- Supabase-backed data model (user profiles, tasks, plans, goals)
- AI system prompts stored in `system_prompts` (Praxis + heroes)
- Daily chat sessions in `chat_sessions` (one per persona per day)
- Frontend loads prompt(s), creates/loads today’s session, saves messages

Why this approach
- Prompts in DB: easy iteration without redeploys
- Per-day sessions: supports daily cadence and retrospective pattern spotting
- Context snapshot: capture relevant state for better responses

Next steps
- Seed more hero prompts
- Optionally load "most recent session" instead of strictly today
- Tighten RLS and add minimal admin tooling for prompts
